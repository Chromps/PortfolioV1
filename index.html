          <h2>Cameron Cody Swift</h2>
          <p>
            I discovered web development in late 2015.  It started with a simple html and javascript class.
            I quickly realized that this was something I really enjoy doing, and decided to re-enroll in college
            after taking a few years off. This year, I will be completing my degree at HVCC and moving on to the
            Informatics program at UAlbany.  I can't wait to learn more about Software Development!

              The classes I have taken at HVCC have given me a strong foundational knowledge
              of computer science topics.  I am excited to build upon this knowledge as I
              continue my education.

              In my free time I have taken many MOOC's from sites including Udacity, Free Code Camp and Lynda.
              I enjoy learning about cutting edge development technologies.  My areas of focus have
              primarily been Web Development and Data Anaylsis.

              <dd>
                I work with the Netowork tools team, helping them monitor over 10,000 routers and switches
                in the NYS Government network.  I also write data mining scripts in python that extract
                errors from large reports for easy use.

              <dd>
                I helped in the development of a Cyber Security news aggregation app.  We used Apache
                Cordova to create a multi-platform app from a web application that we developed using
                Javascript and PHP
